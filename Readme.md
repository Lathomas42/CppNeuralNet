#Cpp Neural Network
## a basic neural network made in cpp

This repository is just beginning so excuse any messy code or projects.

Goals
- Super Basic kNearestNeighbor classifier
- Basic, easy to use neural network
- Impliment different types of networks:
- add multilayer functionality
- attempt to impliment highway network functionality aswell


TODO:
- SVD
- More linear algebra
    - Linear dependence
    - SVD
    - Span
    - Eigendecomp
    - Psuedoinverse
    - PCA
